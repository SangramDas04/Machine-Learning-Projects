# Loan Approval Prediction:

Hi! As you all know loan approval is a critical function in the banking industry and it requires a lot of documents and human intervention as well as a lot of time. With the advent of machine learning, there is an opportunity to revolutionize this process by implementing automated systems that can analyze vast amounts of data and make accurate predictions.

So in this report, I tried to develop machine learning model for predicting bank loan approvals. I used different algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Neighbor Classifier ) so that I can understand which algorithm predicts the output more accurately and finally by comapring the values of Accuracy Score, F1 Socre, Precision and Recall, I determined which algorithm is performing best.

This gives me a deeper understanding of different Machine Learning algorithms and side by side it also helps to apply the theoretical as well as practical knowledge I've gained while learning Machine Learning.
