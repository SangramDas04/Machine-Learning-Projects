# Business Situation:
<BODY>
Mr Aman wants to start his own mobile phone company and he wants to wage an uphill battle with big smartphone brands like Samsung and Apple. 
But he doesn’t know how to estimate the price of a mobile that can cover both marketing and manufacturing costs. So, in this task, you don’t have to predict the actual prices of the mobiles but you have to predict the price range of the mobiles.
